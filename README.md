# Geospatial Analysis of Trees in Buffalo

## Introduction
The project intends to explore and evaluate the Opendata Buffalo tree inventory dataset. The aim of this project is to obtain insights into the distribution patterns and features of tree species in Buffalo by using geospatial tools and statistical analysis.

The collection includes useful information about each tree, such as its Botanical Name, Common Name, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), and different eco-benefits like as stormwater benefits, CO2 avoidance and sequestration, energy benefits, air quality benefits, and property advantages. It also includes address, street, side, site, council district, park name, latitude, longitude, site ID, and location information.

A major goal is to establish the geographical distribution patterns of several tree species around Buffalo. We can reveal critical insights such as the concentration of various tree species inside specific neighborhoods, parks, or council districts by examining the dataset's geospatial properties. This research can help with urban planning, green infrastructure development, and environmental conservation activities.

The geospatial exploration will include mapping tree species distribution using latitude and longitude data. We can discover clusters, gaps, or places of high species diversity inside the metropolis by viewing the geographical patterns. Furthermore, statistical analytic techniques will be used to establish any significant connections between the distribution of tree species and the various ecological benefits.

The project's findings can be used to promote evidence-based decision-making for urban forestry efforts, targeted planting campaigns, and resource prioritization in Buffalo to optimize the positive environmental impact of trees. Finally, the initiative aims to encourage sustainable urban growth, improve inhabitants' quality of life, and contribute to Buffalo's greener and healthier future.
